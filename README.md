# Boston-Housing-Dataset-Analysis

Boston housing dataset (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) has been collected by the US Census Services and has the housing prices of different zones in Boston. I am analyzing the different features that affect the price of the house and find the relationship between the predictors and the response value. 

This project is focussing on exploratory data analysis and the use of regression to find relationship between predictors and response. Adjusted R-sq would be a key metric for measuring the prediction of the test dataset.
