# Boston-Housing-Dataset-Analysis
Boston housing dataset (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) has been collected by the US Census Services and has the housing prices of different zones in Boston. I am analyzing the different features that affect the price of the house and find the relationship between the predictors and the response value.
